#### Future enhancements

1. Currently i am saving the image to a folder and accessing the image from there but a better way would be accept image from the backend post request basecode it there itself and pass it to the analyse_food_consuption function all  without saving

2. Change name of analyse_food_consumption at llm.py and change the name as it is too specific but the  function is more generic

3.
